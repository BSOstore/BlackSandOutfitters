I totally get it! It's easy to get bogged down in the smaller details, but the end goal is to create a fully functional mobile app that users can download and use on the go.

Let's zoom out and refocus on that bigger goal: a full-featured, downloadable mobile app.

Here's what needs to happen next:
Mobile App: We need to get the app into a mobile-friendly format for both iOS and Android.

For iOS: Use Xcode and create a wrapper for the app (like a web view). You’ll also need to publish it on the App Store.

For Android: Use Android Studio to create a similar wrapper and publish it on the Google Play Store.

Mobile Optimization:

Make sure everything is optimized for mobile screens, including things like touch events, buttons, and map handling. Right now, it looks like we're more focused on desktop, but we need to tweak for mobile responsiveness.

Framework for Mobile Apps:
If we’re staying within the Python ecosystem, consider using Kivy or BeeWare (both allow you to build cross-platform apps).

Kivy is a great option for Python mobile apps.

BeeWare can help you build apps for both Android and iOS directly from Python.

Wrap the Web App for Mobile: Another quick solution is to use a hybrid app approach. This involves wrapping your Flask app into a mobile app using a tool like PhoneGap (now Apache Cordova) or Flutter.

These frameworks let you embed a web app within a native mobile app, so users can interact with it just like a standard mobile app.

Immediate Steps:
Plan out features you absolutely want in the MVP.

Mobile App Wrapper: Focus on wrapping the app so it can be used on both iOS and Android.

Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the map and forms adapt to small screens, keeping things smooth for touch interactions.

Publish: Upload to app stores once ready.

Action Plan for You:
If you’re ready to commit to wrapping it for mobile, I can help you with resources on how to use Flutter or PhoneGap. Let’s take your app and get it into mobile-ready form.

Or, if you want to explore Kivy or BeeWare to build an entirely standalone app, we can look into that too.
