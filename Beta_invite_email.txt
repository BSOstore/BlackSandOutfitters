Subject: Exclusive Beta Access – Help Shape the Future of Gold Prospecting

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out because I believe you’ll appreciate what I’ve been building. It’s called AurumAI – an AI-powered gold prospecting app designed to give serious diggers a serious edge. It’s built by someone who’s spent years in the field, not just behind a desk.

I’m inviting a small group of trusted voices in the prospecting world to test drive the beta and give honest feedback before launch. No fluff, no filler – just boots-on-the-ground tech aimed at making your time in the field more productive and profitable.

Here’s what’s inside:

Map-based site logging and note taking

Trip ROI calculator (Are you really making money out there?)

AI-powered site suggestions and tracking (Premium feature)

More smart tools coming soon...

You’ll be among the first to try it – and if you like what you see, I’d love to hear your take or maybe even have you help get the word out.

No pressure, no obligations – just an open invite to be part of something built by a prospector, for prospectors.

Let me know if you're in, and I’ll send over access details.

Best,
[Your Name]
