    <h1>About AurumAI</h1>

    <!-- WHY AURUMAI WAS CREATED -->
    <div class="about-container">
      <p>
        AurumAI wasn’t built in a boardroom. It was born in the dirt — under the sun, next to the shovel,
        chasing streaks of color in black sand. As a prospector with over 30 years of field experience, I grew
        tired of apps built by people who had never even <i>seen</i> a sluice box. I needed something smarter.
        Something intuitive. Something I could actually use in the real world in real time — with gloves on, no signal,
        and the sun in my eyes.
      </p>

      <p>And when I couldn’t find it, I built it myself.</p>

      <p>
        AurumAI is designed for people like you — who don’t need fluff, just function. It’s the tool
        I always wished existed. Even the free version is <i>fully capable</i> of
        serving you in the field as a standalone.
        There's no bait, no switch, no requirement to upgrade for it to function. Just an honest app from an honest
        company. When you're ready, upgrades will still be there. Black Sand Outfitters wants to earn your
        trust first.
      </p>

      <h1>Coming Soon!</h1>
      <p>
        We are planning a <i>ton</i> of upgrades to this app to make it even more useful to you.
        These features and much more are coming in version 1.2.
